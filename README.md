# Pokedex made in React using Redux.

##general info
This project is a simple Pokédex. By default, it displays the first 20 pokemons, and loads 20 more when you click the buttton "Load more".
If you click on the "More details" button, you will see additional information about given pokemon - its weight and height.
You can toggle light and dark theme by clicking the toggle button on the top-left.

While loading the page, there is a small chance that you will see a loading gif - but it shows up only for a moment :)
